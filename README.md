# Mastering-42
less pain, more gain. An opinionated but Science-backed strategy guide of how to get the most out of 42 School, or learning to Program overall.

# Prologue
So. You are an aspiring Programmer, and you wish to be among the ranks of those brilliant thinkers who wrote the software the world runs on?

Prepare for endless nights of Coding, great struggles against your own imagination, capabilities and gcc.
* more excluding, genius-like stereotypes.

# Prologue wrap-up
But fortunately, it does not have to be that way. Many of the hidden assumptions in here aren't even true.
So, for starters:
* Programming is an extremely complex activity, but only rarely complicated.
  * This does not mean, it's easy, or
  * That any of you programmers out there is not doing a particularly hard job.
* And only because it is the case that most of the Programmers right now learned by doing a lot of (Macho-)Programming, that does not mean it is the only or even the best way to learn it.

# Whom is this book for?
For anyone who wants to learn more while doing the 42 Curriculum. This book aims to take some stones out of your way while traversing the Curriculum, while also providing some kind of general map for the Terrain. Note, however, that it aims to be a benevolent Guide for you own long-term learning. It might discuss stuff you do not need right know to solve the task at hand. Rather, it tries to show you what other ways you might walk in order to achieve that. 

# Why?
Because the Curriculum right now is putting stones right in front of you. I am not sure whether this happened by accident or on purpose, and it should force you to ask you peers. What I am sure about, however, is that it hinders learning and slows you down. This time with your peers surely is better spent on discussing different approachs of how to solve a Project, rather than on figuring out what the hell the projects want you to do. 

# Purpose of this book, Goals for this book
This book is written for the ones who want to learn more than needed to complete the projects.
I'd like to provide: 
* A Map of the terrain next to each project, and from one to another.
* A good mindset to learn stuff.
* A comprehensive additional resource for each project
* As well as general advice on doing stuff at 42, programming-related and non-programming-related.

# first content
* Programming does not have to be about math. It is, however, to a very large extent, about process.
* Language aptitude seems to have a better predicitive power about whether one can learn to program than numeracy.
